# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up a player with full movement and default level generations. Animations and scripts were added to the player to make the player move physically and make the sprite animated as to not look boring. The level generation was drawn with a sprite resembling a pencil, and a script was added to make the level random and scroll with the player. A segment of the line kept getting copied and pasted with different positions to give the terrain some variety.
