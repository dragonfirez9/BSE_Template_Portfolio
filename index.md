# Demo Night Video
My Demo Night Video showcased my project in full. I explained what I gained from the course as well as demonstrating the project.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was fully completing the game. I set up spawners for powerups as well as bombs and bonus platforms. After you died, the game transported you to a seperate scene where your score as well as options to restart were added. Finally, difficulty modes were set up for an extra challenge if the user wanted.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up a player with full movement and default level generations. Animations and scripts were added to the player to make the player move physically and make the sprite animated as to not look boring. The level generation was drawn with a sprite resembling a pencil, and a script was added to make the level random and scroll with the player. A segment of the line kept getting copied and pasted with different positions to give the terrain some variety.
